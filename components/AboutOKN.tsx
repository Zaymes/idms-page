              Open Knowledge Nepal is a nonprofit civic tech organization composed of openness aficionados. We believe that the openness of data is powerful in order to have a participatory government with civil society, eventually leading to sustainable development. The organization has been involved in research, advocacy, training, workshops and developing tools related to open knowledge. We provide data services and solutions to various agencies and specialized in solving data-related problems through consultation and tools development.

              We want to make sure that everyone in Nepal has free and open access to the key information, empowering them to make decisions about their own lives based on the information that wasnâ€™t available before. Open Knowledge Nepal has been a local chapter of Open Knowledge Foundation since February 2013.
